# gameTracker
Video Game Completion/Collection Tracker using MySQL.

This was a project that was more meant for learning purposes, but the final (?) product is still something I'm happy with.

You can use this by cloning the project into InteliJ and building a jar, or you can use a pre-compiled one that is found in the out folder.

You will need the SQLite folder to live in the same folder as the .jar, as well as Java 8. And that's all there is to installation.
